Introduction
============
This software aims to be a reliable ongoing network monitor that periodically
reports counters for bytes, packets, flows and users for each application
protocol supported by libprotoident.


Required Libraries
==================
libtrace
 * available from http://research.wand.net.nz/software/libtrace.php

libprotoident
 * available from http://research.wand.net.nz/software/libprotoident.php

libflowmanager
 * available from http://research.wand.net.nz/software/libflowmanager.php

libfifo
 * available from http://research.wand.net.nz/software/libfifo.php

libwandevent
 * available from http://research.wand.net.nz/software/libwandevent.php


Installation
============
After having installed the required libraries, running the following series
of commands should install lpicollector

        ./configure
        make
        make install

By default, lpicollector installs to /usr/local - this can be changed by
appending the --prefix=<new location> option to ./configure.

Also, if you have installed any of the required libraries to a non-standard
location, you will need to tell ./configure where the libraries and header
files can be found using LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS.


Running lpicollector
====================
lpicollector supports a large number of command-line options. Some of the
options have not been fully tested -- these are marked as experimental in
the list below. If an option is experimental, use it at your own risk!

Basic options:
 -f <filter>:  Ignore packets that do not match the given BPF filter string.
 -p <port>:    Listen for incoming connections on this port -- default is 3678.
 -c <clients>: Limit the number of connected clients to this number.
 -s <bytes>:   Size of the internal message fifo in bytes. Default is 100MB.
 -R:           If set, all flows using RFC 1918 address space are ignored.
 -r <freq>:    Report statistics every <freq> seconds.
 -i <id>:      ID string to use for this monitor, defaults to $HOSTNAME.

Direction tagging  (choose one of these options):
 -P:           Use port number to determine direction. This is the least
               accurate method of assigning direction but will always work.

 -T:           Use existing direction tags to determine direction. This is
               the best method, but requires your packet capture to correctly
               assign direction to each packet. Don't use this with pcap.

 -l <mac>:     Assign direction to each packet based on the given MAC address
               representing the 'inside' portion of the network. Therefore,
               packets with a source MAC address of <mac> will be deemed as
               outgoing and packets with a dest MAC address of <mac> will be
               deemed as incoming.

If no tagging method is provided, -T is assumed. 

User tracking (experimental):
 -U:           Track and report LPI statistics separately for each observed 
               'local' IP address. An IP address is determined to be local
               based on the direction tag, so only use this option if you
               have accurate direction tagging. Don't use this if you have
               set the -P option!

               All addresses that receive incoming packets or send outgoing
               packets are treated as local addresses for this purpose.

               Enabling this will greatly increase the amount of memory
               required by the lpicollector, especially if you are monitoring
               a large network with a lot of users. 


Individual Flow monitoring (experimental):
 -E, -O:       Enable reporting expired and ongoing flows, respectively. This
               will cause lpicollector to act as a flow meter. I wouldn't
               recommend enabling this, unless you really know what you're
               doing.
 -e <freq>:    Report expired flows every <freq> seconds.
 -v <freq>:    Report ongoing flows every <freq> seconds.
 -o <seconds>: Number of seconds that a flow must run to be classified as
               ongoing.
